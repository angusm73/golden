                <span>Angus Moore is committed to providing quality services to
                    you and this policy outlines our ongoing obligations to you
                    in respect of how we manage your Personal Information. <br>
                    We have adopted the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs)
                    contained in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (the Privacy Act).
                    The NPPs govern the way in which we collect, use, disclose,
                    store, secure and dispose of your Personal Information. <br>
                    A copy of the Australian Privacy Principles may be obtained

            <h2>What is Personal Information and why do we collect it?</h2>
            <p>
                <span>Personal Information is information or an opinion that
                    identifies an individual. Examples of Personal Information
                    we collect include: names, addresses, email addresses, phone
                    and facsimile numbers. <br> This Personal Information is
                    obtained in many ways including correspondence, by telephone
                    and facsimile, by email, via our website angus.digital, from
                    your website, from media and publications, from other
                    publicly available sources, from cookies and from third
                    parties. We donâ€™t guarantee website links or policy of
                    authorised third parties. <br> We collect your Personal
                    Information for the primary purpose of providing our
                    services to you, providing information to our clients and
                    marketing. We may also use your Personal Information for
                    secondary purposes closely related to the primary purpose,
                    in circumstances where you would reasonably expect such use
                    or disclosure. You may unsubscribe from our
                    mailing/marketing lists at any time by contacting us in
                    writing. <br> When we collect Personal Information we will,
                    where appropriate and where possible, explain to you why we
                    are collecting the information and how we plan to use it.

                    purpose for which it was obtained, we will take reasonable
