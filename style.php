                shock, and that is because we don't quite fully understand.
                Why should we? After all, we're too small to realise its
                final pattern. Therefore don't try and judge it from where
                you stand. We are always in trouble! Isn't it
                extraordinary—it follows us everywhere. People spend all
                their time making nice things and then other people come
